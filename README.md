<pre>Quick start

Set this up first in Visual Studio Code (Or don't.
Just know when you press TAB in this editor it generates spaces instead):
  
  Click [{} plain text] on the bottom right.
  
  Click Configure 'Plain Text' language based settings...
  
  Add this 👇 to enable tab characters for .txt files instead of the default spaces.
  
  <code>"[plaintext]": {
    "editor.insertSpaces": false
  }</code>

Now I'll explain how to program your keyboard to function anunnaki style.

First thing to do is plan which two keys you'll be using for your shortcut.
I made it so each key shows its corresponding value in the program
when the key is pressed. Look:
<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb97b010-7340-4ca3-8988-ed7085642a3a" />

These keys are pretty much the input (to make it more or less than two keys,
in c:\anu\se.txt, adjust the InputLength setting; CTRL+S to update the program). 

Lets start adding codes to c:\anu\db.txt.

But first, know this:

After adding codes to db.txt in Visual Studio Code,
press CTRL+S to save. When pressing CTRL+S, the
program will update itself to see the codes.

Codes in c:\anu\db.txt have this format
(with the corresponding middle-symbol between the input and output):

in out
in-out
in:out
in>out

For multi-line use this format
(with the \ before the middle symbol and another on the end of the final line):

in\>
  out
\

Using the multi-line format compresses it to one line by removing
newlines and tabs after saving of course.

Use space or - character as the middle symbol for auto-backspace-input
(like in the first two examples above).

Use > when you want it to output the input as well for whatever reason for repeat
(see further below which key to press for repeat).

Also know this:

The input section is for your shortcut.
The output section is what will run.

And, each line in db.txt is a slot for its own shortcut.
Imagine it looks something like this:
[input][middle-symbol][output]
[input][middle-symbol][output]

Now for the fun stuff. Here's a simple emoji example.
👇 Save this to db.txt:

in 💥

You can have more than one input to run the same output.
Just place only an input above where it has an input and output:

i
in 💥

To run the out, first CTRL+S to save then press:
I N RCTRL
I N F2
I N RSHIFT+LSHIFT (Hold RSHIFT, press LSHIFT, release RSHIFT)
or
I RCTRL...

To repeat, press:
PAUSE/BREAK key
or 
RCTRL+LCTRL (Hold RCTRL, press LCTRL, release RCTRL)

If these keys aren't available on your keyboard,
press EQUAL+ESC for repeat. COMMA+ESC instead of RCTRL for running.

To clear the input, press BACKSPACE a few times or use this combo:
Hold RSHIFT, Press LSHIFT three times, release RSHIFT
(Pressing LSHIFT only twice clears it to &lt;.
Press once when it's already cleared for &lt;
or for run if it's filled with an input).

Let's expand.

For teleport and mouse press, click in db.txt,
hover over the target, press P+ESC.
It will auto type something like this &lt;xy~:273 1365>.
The ~ means it will store the location first
then it will teleport to x y location: 273 1365.
For left click, use &lt;lc>
(Left click more than once &lt;lc2>).

Example:

in &lt;xy~:273 1365>&lt;lc>&lt;~~>

The &lt;~~> will return the x y to where it was stored.

Maybe sometimes you might have to slow it down and put some wait time like this
(using this &lt;,> option):
  
in &lt;xy~:273 1365>&lt;,>&lt;lc>&lt;,>&lt;~~>
  
Maybe that's not enough time (160ms default).
Add more milliseconds to this like so: &lt;,1000> (this is one second).

Can also use the &lt;speed:> option instead:

in &lt;speed:160>&lt;xy~:273 1365>&lt;lc>&lt;~~>

To see what options this program has to offer, press ?+ESC.

and I'll be glad to answer them.

Enjoy my Anunnaki blooded friend.
You are a brave soul and I appreciate you very much (trust)❗
May the programming Gods be with you ⚔️‼️
